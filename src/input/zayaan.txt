Paint is a liquid or solid mixture of pigments (for color) and a binder (to hold it together), suspended in a solvent (like water or oil) that allows it to be spread as a thin, protective, and decorative coating that dries into a solid film. It's used to color surfaces, add texture, and protect them from weathering, corrosion, and damage, with common types including water-based (latex/acrylic) and oil-based paints.

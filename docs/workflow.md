# Workflow Overview

## Purpose
This document describes the logical workflow of the system.

## Initial Workflow (Draft)
1. Document is uploaded or received
2. File type and quality are checked
3. Text is extracted from the document
4. Extracted data is validated
5. Results are stored
6. Output is generated

This workflow will evolve as the system is built.

This workflow will evolve as the system is built.

## Day 2 Update – Local File Processing

The system can now:
- Scan files from an input directory
- Extract basic metadata (name, size)
- Generate a processing report
- Store output in a structured folder

This forms the base of future document automation.
